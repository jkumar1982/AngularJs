### In this exercise, you will learn the basics of testing AngularJS artifacts.
1. Checkout the __'initial' tag__ from the repository and have a look at the file __'app.js'__.
2. Checkout on __'first-initial'__ and run the tests with the command __'npm test'__.
3. Complete the unit tests in __'greeter-service.spec.js'__ and compare them with commit __'first-final'__.
4. Repeat the process for the other two exercises.
5. Separate the __'app.js'__ artifacts in dedicated files.
