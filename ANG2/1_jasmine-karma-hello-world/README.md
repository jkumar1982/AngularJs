AngularJS Course - Jasmine & Karma Hello World
==============================================

### In this exercise, you will learn how to setup a minimal JS application using [Node Package Manager](http://nodejs.org/) and to test it with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) as test framework and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) as test runner.
1. Checkout the __'initial' tag__ from the repository and have a look at the file: __'calculator.js'__ and __'calculator.spec.js'__.
2. Execute the tests in Karma by issuing the command __'npm test'__ in a console.
3. Checkout the __'complete_implementation'__ branch and complete the methods of the calculator implementation to make the tests pass again.
4. Checkout the __'complete_tests'__ branch and complete the methods of the calculator test specification to make the tests pass again.
5. Checkout the __'initial'__ tag once again and add __support for ES6__ in __'karma.conf.js'__.
6. Implement the calculator as a __ES6 class__.
7. Apply the __ES6 arrow function__ where suitable.
8. Apply __ES6 string templates__ where suitable.
9. Explore the npm configuration file __'package.json'__ to understand the basics of JS dependency management with __npm__.
