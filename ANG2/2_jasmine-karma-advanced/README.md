AngularJS Course - Jasmine & Karma Advanced
===========================================

### In this exercise, you will learn how to use advanced features from Jasmine as Spies and Custom Matchers.
1. Checkout the __'initial' tag__ from the repository and have a look at the file: __'calculator.js'__ and __'calculator.spec.js'__.
2. Extract the __push()__ and __pop()__ methods into a new __Stack__ abstraction by mean of a ES6 class.
3. Make the Calculator class receive the Stack implementation as a constructor parameter and use __Jasmine Spies__ to test this new dependency.
4. Have a look at the implementation of the __'toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith()'__ Jasmine custom matcher.
