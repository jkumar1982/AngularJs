AngularJS Course - Angular DOM
==============================

### In this exercise, you will learn how to modify the DOM by using AngularJS directives.
1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Have a look at the tags issuing the command: __"git log --tags --pretty=format:'%d %s'"__.
3. Perform __'bower install'__ and open __'app/index.html'__ -> All the examples should work.
4. Import the project in the IDE and have a look at __'app/index.html'__.
5. Checkout the first exercise in its initial state: __'git checkout first-initial'__
6. Solve the exercise and continue to exercises 2nd to 4th

__Note:__ you can always have a look at the __'...-resolved'__ tag to see the solution.
