AngularJS Course - Jasmine & Karma Hello World
==============================================

### In this exercise, you will learn how to setup a minimal JS application using [Node Package Manager](http://nodejs.org/) and to test it with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) as test framework and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) as test runner.
1. Checkout the __initial step ('initial' tag)__ from the repository and have a look at the file: __'calculator.js'__ and __'calculator.spec.js'__.
2. The goal is to make the tests pass by completing the calculator implementation.
3. Install the Karma test runner and run the tests:
   1. in a console, execute the command: __'npm install karma karma-jasmine karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev'__.
   2. to start Karma, execute the command: __'npm run test'__.
4. Complete the methods of the calculator implementation to make the tests pass.
5. Have a look at the Karma configuration file __('karma.conf.js')__.
6. Look at the tests in detail __('calculator.spec.js')__ to understand how Jasmine works.
7. Explore the npm configuration file __('package.json')__ to understand the basics of JS dependency management.
