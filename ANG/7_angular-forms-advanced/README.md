AngularJS Course - Forms Advanced
=================================

### In this exercise, you will learn how to create highly usable forms in AngularJS
1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Have a look at the tags issuing the command: __"git log --tags --pretty=format:'%d %s'"__.
3. Perform __'npm install'__ and __'bower install'__ and issue the command __'node backend.js'__ to start the web server.
4. Open the URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and play around with the form.
5. Import the project in the IDE and have a look at __'app/index.html'__ and __'backend.js'__.
6. Checkout the first step of the exercise: __'git checkout first'__.
7. Implement a directive __('has-errors')__ which, when applied to a container, changes its appearance based on the validity
   of the contained fields and the state of the form __('pristine': warning, 'dirty': error)__.
8. Checkout the second step of the exercise: __'git checkout second'__.
9. Implement a directive __('error-bar')__ which listens to backend errors and shows them as dismissible alerts.
